\begin{warning}
    \textbf{Challenge}: You discover that your model may be misused (for malicious purposes)

    \textbf{Solution}:

    Implement licensing and Terms of Use:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use a license agreement and terms of use aligned with the ethical document and established conditions. Example: The program should only be usable by authorized individuals or organizations, exclusively for medical purposes, and not to discriminate or exploit individuals beyond improving their health.
        \item Seek legal counsel regarding the repercussions for those who violate these terms.
        \item Example of misuse: Insurance companies exploiting the program for discriminatory purposes.
    \end{itemize}

    Also required actions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item System Layer Level
        \item Application Layer Level
        \item Database (BBDD) Layer Level
    \end{itemize}
